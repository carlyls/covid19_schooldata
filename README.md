Comparisons of school policy datasets during the COVID-19 Pandemic

The code in this repository is used in the paper entitled "Consistency between household and county measures of onsite schooling during the COVID-19 pandemic", currently In Press.

"comparing_datasets_setup_23Sep2022" contains code to combine datasets aggregated up to the district, county, and state levels. 
"comparing_datasets_analysis_23Sep2022" contains code to make the plots and analyses described in the paper.

To access the individual-level data, publicly available data can be found at https://osf.io/tpwqf/. Two other datasets are available if granted access, and they can be requested through the Delphi Group at CMU (https://delphi.cmu.edu/covidcast/) and Burbio (https://about.burbio.com/school-opening-tracker).
